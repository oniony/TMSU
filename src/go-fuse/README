GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.


HIGHLIGHTS

* High speed: less than 50% slower than libfuse, using the gc
compiler.  For most real world applications, the difference will be
negligible.

* Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
subdirectories of the FUSE mount.

* Supports 3 interfaces for writing filesystems:
  - PathFileSystem: define filesystems in terms path names.
  - NodeFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of inodes.
  - RawFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of FUSE's raw
  wire protocol.

* Both NodeFileSystem and PathFileSystem support manipulation of true
  hardlinks.
  
* Includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.


EXAMPLES

* examples/hello/hello.go contains a 60-line "hello world" filesystem

* zipfs/zipfs.go contains a small and simple read-only filesystem for
  zip and tar files. The corresponding command is in example/zipfs/
  For example,

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/zipfs/zipfs /tmp/mountpoint file.zip &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* zipfs/multizipfs.go shows how to use in-process mounts to
  combine multiple Go-FUSE filesystems into a larger filesystem.

* fuse/loopback.go mounts another piece of the filesystem.
  Functionally, it is similar to a symlink.  A binary to run is in
  example/loopback/ . For example

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/loopback/loopback -debug /tmp/mountpoint /some/other/directory &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* unionfs/unionfs.go: implements a union mount using 1 R/W branch, and
  multiple R/O branches.

    mkdir -p  /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable
    example/unionfs/unionfs /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable /usr &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    rm /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    cat /tmp/writable/*DELETION*/*

* union/autounionfs.go: creates UnionFs mounts automatically based on
  existence of READONLY symlinks.


Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14).
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).


BENCHMARKS

We use threaded stats over a read-only filesystem for benchmarking.
Automated code is under benchmark/ .sh.  A simple C version of the
same FS gives a FUSE baseline

Data points (time per stat, Go-FUSE version Sep 3), using java 1.6
src.zip (7000 files).

BUGS

Yes, probably.  Report them through golang-nuts@googlegroups.com.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

Grep source code for TODO.  Major topics:

* Support for umask in Create

* Use splice for transporting data, use io.Reader in API.

* Opendir/Readdir does not support seeking

* Missing support for network FS file locking: FUSE_GETLK, FUSE_SETLK,
  FUSE_SETLKW

* Missing support for FUSE_INTERRUPT, CUSE, BMAP, POLL, IOCTL

* In the path API, renames are racy; See also:
